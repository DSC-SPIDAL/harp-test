# ABSTRACT
[Harp LDA](https://github.iu.edu/IU-Big-Data-Lab/Harp/tree/master/harp3-tutorial-app/LDA) is a distributed variational bayes inference (VB) algorithm for LDA model which would be able to model a large and continuously expanding dataset using Harp collective communication library. We demonstrate how variational bayes inference converges within Map-Collective jobs provided by Harp. We provide results of the experiments conducted on a corpus of Wikipedia Dataset.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Harp[2] is a collective communication library plugged in Hadoop plug-in to accelerate machine learning algorithms.

LDA[3] is a popular topic modeling algorithm. We follow the Mr.LDA[4] to implement distributed variational inference LDA on Harp with itâ€™s dynamic schedueler, allreduce and push-pull communication models.

# CONCLUSION
Harp-LDA is proposed to provide high scalability achieve better performance with shorter time and memory requirements. A clear evidence of convergence of likelihood after a certain number of iterations is depicted. The results from the speed up chart illustrate high scalability.
